# 1) Write a short Python script which queries the user for input (infinite loop with exit possibility) and writes the input to a file.
# 2) Add another option to your user interface: The user should be able to output the data stored in the file in the terminal.
# 3) Store user input in a list (instead of directly adding it to the file) and write that list to the file â€“ both with pickle and json.
import json
import pickle

        f.write(json.dumps(file_contents))
        f.write('\n')

    print('Write Complete!')

def print_from_file():
    with open('assignment_6.txt', mode='r') as f:
        file_content = f.readlines()
        print(file_content)
    
    print('Read Complete!')

    elif user_input == 'x':
        input_state = False
    else:

print("Program Completed!")


# 4) Adjust the logic to load the file content to work with pickled/ json data.
